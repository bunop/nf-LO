# Outputs

*nf-LO* will save the outputs from the analyses in the folder specified with `--outdir PREFIX`.
Inside this folder, you will find the following subfolders. The most important is `PREFIX/chainnet`, that contains the chain/net files that you can use to perform the liftover of the positions.

Here is a detailed list of the output folders:
1. genome2bit: this folder will contain the input genomes converted to 2bit format, coupled with the respective size file
2. singlechains: single chain files generated from the raw alignments; if the alignment is performed in chunks, then this folder will contain one chain per single alignment
3. rawchain: this folder includes one chain file, generated by combining the single chain files in singlechains folder
4. chainnet: contains the refined chain/net files, that can be used for liftover 
5. maf: this folder contains the maf (multiple alingment format) generated from the chain file; optional
6. lifted: this folder contains the lifted and unlifted positions (present only when a file to lift is provided, see [here](https://github.com/evotools/nf-LO/wiki/Lift-over-positions) for details on the accepted inputs).
7. reports: this folder contains the HTML reports for the workflow (cpu times, task-specific times etc) as well as the metrics for the chain (if `--maf` flag is specified and [mafTools](https://github.com/ComparativeGenomicsToolkit/mafTools) is installed) and lifted annotation (if an annotation is provided).
